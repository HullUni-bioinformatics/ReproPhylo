## ReproPhylo: Reproducible Phylogenetics
This is a place to make a plan!

## EDA: Exploratory Data Analysis of Input
The idea here is to quantify and characterise the raw sequence data.
Works on genbank files, though might need more extensive testing.

Done:
* Characterise lengths and plot out distribution of lengths
* Characterise %GC and plot out distribution of %GC

Not done:
* List all seq features, with counts
* List all CDS names, with counts
