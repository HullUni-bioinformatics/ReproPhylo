      "<font size=4>The format guesser will generate a text file cotatining a table with all the file names and their format. It will be called several times along the workflow and will update the table. The initial guess made by the Bio::Tools::GuessSeqFormat has to be extanded to make more accurate guesses (eg, strict or relaxed? interleave or sequetial? are the titles of the sequences iterated in each block or do they apear only in the first block, etc.). Python modules that have to decide if a reformat is needed and for a downstreem analysis can check the files format in the formats table."
